    <h3 style="margin-top: 60px">How to get around in Zanzibar</h3>
    <p>
      There are two options: the local dala dalas and taxis. There are also
      shared buses that leave from Stone Town to the beaches, which you can
      usually get for USD 10 per person. Public transportation/dala dalas:
      Public transportation is extremely affordable, costing under USD 4,
      depending on your destination. They are also quite slow as they stop a lot
      on the way, and there usually seems to be no limit to how many people can
      fit on one bus! Be warned that it’ll probably take some effort to figure
      out which dala dala to use, though the conductors are very helpful. Taxis:
      There are lots of taxis in Stone Town, but from the beach they can be
      harder to find. It’s always good to ask your hotel for a taxi or find a
      reliable company to offer you transfers. Taking a taxi in Zanzibar is
      generally safe, but note they’re often not punctual and tend to charge as
      they wish. There are some companies in Zanzibar offering taxi services
      (such as the aptly named Zanzibar Taxi), but none are available on demand
      — you’ll need to let them know ahead of time when you wish to go and
      where. Walking: Walking is the most efficient way to get around if you are
      staying in Stone Town! The town is small and safe to walk, as long as you
      keep an eye out for the fast-moving vespas. When you wander a bit further
      from the more popular, touristy areas, you will find walking very
      pleasant, too.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Eating in Zanzibar</h3>
    <p>
      Zanzibar has a very mixed food culture, so expect to find mainland
      Tanzanian favourites as well as Indian and Arabic foods. Seafood is, of
      course, a main part of Zanzibari food culture, with different curries,
      sauces, soups and fried dishes. Food is spicy, but not hot — hot sauce
      (pilipili) is usually served separately, so you can avoid it if you’re not
      a fan of the heat. Zanzibari food is very vegetarian and vegan-friendly,
      as most dishes are dairy-free and meat is often served separately.
      Basically all restaurants have vegetarian options and some Indian
      restaurants in Stone Town only serve vegetarian food. For local food,
      Lukmaan Restaurant in Stone Town is one of the most relibale places,
      always serving great food for excellent value. The Forodhani Night Market
      is another must-experience, but your best bet is to go where you see the
      locals go — that way you know the food is likely to be fresh. When in
      doubt, sit at one of the cafés and order something there. Tea and coffee
      are essential in Zanzibar culture, so be sure to have some. They often
      come prepared with spices and are delicious. And don’t forget the juicy
      fresh fruits available basically everywhere.

  <h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Where to stay in Zanzibar</h3>
  <p>
    Nungwi and Kendwa beaches are truly beautiful; they are on the only side of
    the island which is consistently crystal clear water lapping brilliant white
    sands. The northern beaches really are where to stay in Zanzibar if you are
    looking for that idyllic Indian Ocean beach experience.
