    Tenerife is considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe. Located in
    the Canary Islands, just off the coast of Africa, Tenerife is blessed with
    year round sunshine, warm weather and epic waves. It’s a popular destination
    for anyone searching for some European winter sun, as well as a dream
    destination for outdoors lovers. There are many awesome things to do in
    Tenerife, and many revolve around the great outdoors and water sports. If
    you’re planning a 4-day break in Tenerife, the Teide National Park is bound
    to be at the top of your list. And you’re spot on, because the Park is
    Tenerife’s number one attraction. But there’s a lot more you can see in
    Tenerife in 4 days. Cities where time seems to have stood still; natural
    parks where you can see the island’s volcanic origins; beaches where you can
    lie in the sun or bathe in the crystal-clear waters, or you can sample our
    delicious gastronomy—these are just some of the essentials in Tenerife.Break
    free, open your mind and go and pack your suitcase, because we’ve prepared a
    4-day itinerary for you, to make sure you don’t miss anything of what
    Tenerife has to offer. So let’s get started!

    <h3 style="margin-top: 60px">How to get around in Tenerife</h3>
    <p>
      Let’s start by saying that the best way to conveniently, reliably and
      sustainably discover all there is to see in Tenerife if you only have 4
      days, is with an organised excursion.Convenient because you don’t have to
      worry about how to get to places, or parking, or filling up with fuel, or
      planning. Reliable because you know for certain where you are going and at
      what time you will arrive.Having said that, to plan how to get around
      Tenerife, you need to know that buses or guaguas (as they’re known in the
      Canary Islands) serve almost every corner of the island, and that you have
      the option of public transport and an endless range of organised
      excursions. In Santa Cruz-La Laguna, there is a tram network, and all the
      towns have taxis.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Where to surf in Tenerife</h3>
    <p>
      If you want to do surf lessons in Tenerife, I can highly recommend Surf
      Life Tenerife. Located in Las Americas, it’s the surf school that I did
      classes and rentals with for four months. Their surf instructors are all
      excellent surfers, as well as being super qualified and friendly. You can
      tell they love what they do, and genuinely want people to have the best
      surf experience possible. They offer a variety of classes and experiences,
      including beginner group classes, private lessons, a premium package for
      those looking to step up from intermediate surfers to advanced, surf skate
      lessons and rentals.

  <h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Where to stay in Tenerife</h3>
  <p>
    Where can you stay so that you get to see everything in Tenerife in 4 days?
    As you might imagine, the range of accommodation in Tenerife is enormous:
    hotels, holiday cottages, apartments, guest houses, houses with a swimming
    pool... the island offers all types of accommodation, and for all budgets.
    To help you orientate yourself, we would say that the areas offering the
    broadest range of hotels and services are: In the north, Puerto de la Cruz
    and the metropolitan area of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and La Laguna. In the
    south, Playa de las Américas and Costa Adeje. We suggest you look for
    somewhere to stay in a place that suits you in any of these resorts or
    cities, and use it as a base from which to set off every day. If you are
    travelling as a family, the perfect solution is to stay in a hotel in the
    south on half board or on full board, and in the north, in a hotel located
    close to public transport services. And that brings us to an end of our
    recommendations on all you can see and do in Tenerife in 4 days. You could
    follow this 4-day Tenerife itinerary closely, or adjust it to your personal
    circumstances and preferences—every traveller is different, and holidays are
    for getting to know new places and people, but they’re also for resting body
    and mind. And for that, there is nowhere like Tenerife.

    Day 1. Visit Mount Teide, La Orotava and Puerto de la Cruz: ideas for you
    Tenerife tour that you won’t want to miss
  </h3>
  <p>
    Your first day on Tenerife, so get off to a flying start with the places
    that are bound to be at the top of your list. To space out the power and
    excitement, we suggest the Teide National Park for the first half of the
    day, and for the second half, two delightful cities: historic La Orotava and
    the coastal city of Puerto de la Cruz, which could well be where you’ll stay
    overnight. But think about it carefully, because the order of your visits
    has consequences. We say this because if you decide to go to to Mount Teide
    during the morning, you will have very clear views and be able to enjoy the
    morning freshness and, if it’s the weekend, you can have a delicious lunch
    in Spain’s highest restaurant On the other hand, if you go in the evening,
    you can stay to see the sunset, as well as the star-studded sky above Mount
    Teide, one of Tenerife’s great highlights.

    Day 2. Visit La Laguna, the Anaga Rural Park and Playa de las Teresitas
  </h3>
  <p>
    We’re going to spend our second day in Tenerife exploring the north-east of
    the island and seeing stunning scenery along with one of the island’s most
    characterful cities, San Cristóbal de La Laguna. We will also stop off at a
    wonderful beach to unwind: Playa de las Teresitas. Just like your first day
    in Tenerife, you can do urban sightseeing first, and then move on to nature,
    or vice-versa, whichever you prefer. If you accept our recommendation,
    however, you’ll start in San Cristóbal de La Laguna, because after a visit
    to the Anaga Rural Park and the beach, you may not have the energy. Off we
    go on our second full day of places to see in Tenerife.

  <h3 style="margin-top: 60px">
    Day 3. Visit Icod de Los Vinos, Garachico and Los Silos
  </h3>
  <p>
    Ideas for a day exploring the north-west of Tenerife, one of the island’s
    most fascinating areas thanks to its landscape, its wines and its flora, the
    highlight of which is a dragon tree that is at least 800 years old, el Drago
    Milenario, a rara avis that can only be found in Tenerife. This will be a
    day dedicated to the culture of the Canary Island and of Tenerife, a day of
    strolling, eating well, taking photos and sampling the area’s wines, which
    are different from anything you may have drunk until now. Wearing
    comfortable footwear and with camera in hand, we set out for Icod de los
    Vinos on the third of our 4 days in Tenerife.

    Day 4. Visit Los Gigantes and Masca, and enjoy the thrill of whale spotting
  </h3>
  <p>
    To complete our tour of recommended sights in Tenerife, we now make our way
    to the south-west of the island, to another place that is full of life with
    accommodation to suit all tastes, from which there are plenty of excursions
    to Mount Teide. But we’re not taking you out shopping or partying, although
    we could: we’re going to focus on the natural world. Here, you can sail past
    imposing volcanic cliffs, enjoy a Jeep safari adventure through Masca, a
    landscape of immense geological interest, and see dolphins and whales in
    their natural habitat.
