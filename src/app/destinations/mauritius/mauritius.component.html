    <h3 style="margin-top: 60px">How to get around in Mauritius</h3>
    <p>
      Rental: If you want to discover the island by yourself at your own pace,
      the best thing is to rent a car, a scooter or a bicycle, depending on the
      distance to travel, and to bring a map or a GPS. The rental prices are
      quite affordable. Always keep in mind that driving is on the left-hand
      side in Mauritius, and the priority is given to those coming from the
      right. Do not hesitate to ask people on the road if you do not find your
      way!<br />
      Excursions: Local tourist operators can organise excursions across the
      island and sea trips to the islets surrounding Mauritius; the journey will
      be done by bus or car depending on the number of people. Taxis also offer
      day packages to visit different regions, above normal trips. Taxis are
      found at the hotel, at the airport and on the various dedicated parking
      areas in towns and villages, close to the bus stations. <br />Public
      transport: Those who want to immerse themselves in Mauritian life and make
      encounters, try at least once to travel by bus. Almost all the main routes
      of the island are served by the different bus companies operating in
      Mauritius. In town, the operating hours are from 5:30 am to 8:30 pm and in
      rural areas from 6:30 am to 6:30 pm. Before going out, check the operating
      hours of the buses in the region at the reception or with your host.

  <p>
    When it comes to places to stay in Mauritius, you’re spoiled for choice, the
    North, West, South and East costs all have something different to offer, and
    all are worth a stay. The best side of Mauritius however has to be the West
    coast, purely for the variety it offers in terms of culture (Port Louis),
    Exploration and natural wonders (Le Morne Brabant) and arguably the island’s
    most popular resort; Fliq en Flaq

  <h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Day 1. The Northern Beaches</h3>
  <p>
    You have just landed and you are full of enthusiasm to discover Mauritius!
    Before we start, I highly recommend renting a car when you arrive. The buses
    serve the island very well but the journeys are endless… Renting a car in
    Mauritius will allow you to move from one point to another easily and to
    optimize your time. Once you have collected your car and left your luggage
    at the hotel, take the road towards the north of the island. The North coast
    is perfect for getting into the bath as it is one of the most attractive and
    lively corners. What I advise you for this first day is to discover the
    beaches of the North. The successive beaches of Grand Baie, Peyrébère and
    Cap Malheureux are magnificent. Have you dreamed of white sand, sun and
    coconut palms? You will be served! The beaches of Mont Choisy and Trou aux
    Biches, a few kilometers away, are also worth a look.

    Day 2. Flic en Flac and the Black River Gorges Park
  </h3>
  <p>
    After a good night’s sleep, I now invite you to discover the west coast of
    Mauritius. The town of Flic en Flac is the nerve center, with its
    magnificent beach which stretches over 8 km. Flic en Flac beach is one of
    the most popular on the island. With its white sand and its translucent
    waters populated by multicolored fish, it is the ideal place to indulge in
    idleness and snorkelling. You will also find a host of diving centers in the
    surrounding area if you want to discover the seabed in a bottle. Tips for
    your Mauritius itinerary: Several small trailers offer snacks and fresh
    fruit to enjoy facing the sea. I recommend that you try the famous “Roti
    Aka” at the trailer of the same name which is located at the start of the
    beach. “Roti” (also called “farata”) is a local specialty that resembles an
    Indian naan filled with different curries and sauces. You can eat them all
    over the island, but the Roti Aka from Flic en Flac are particularly
    delicious! About 15 km from Flic en Flac is the Black River Gorges National
    Park which I recommend you visit as well. It is a nature reserve in the
    middle of the tropical forest. You can walk the trails to discover the
    Mauritian flora and fauna. Be careful, it climbs quite a bit! On the course,
    you will have the opportunity to admire magnificent views of the coast and
    the ocean. In order not to miss the most beautiful corners of the park, I
    recommend that you take a guide. There are many different trails and it’s
    much better to be accompanied for the first time. I advise you to book your
    guided tour here. Between the beach and the natural park, you will easily
    have enough for the day. It’s up to you to see in which order to do them
    according to your desires. And if you like to go out in the evening, you can
    even spend the evening/night in Flic en Flac since there are many
    restaurants, pubs and nightclubs there.

  <h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Day 3. Grand Bassin and Chamarel</h3>
  <p>
    For this third day of your 5-day trip to Mauritius, head south-west. I
    propose here a short road-trip between different sites to see, among others,
    the sacred lake of Grand Bassin and the Earth of the 7 Colors of Chamarel.
    Here is the itinerary that I propose for this condensed visit of the
    South-West : 1. Leave in the morning towards Grand Bassin (also called
    “Ganga Talao”): this sacred lake is a place of pilgrimage and prayer for
    Mauritian Hindus. The site is overlooked by two huge and impressive statues
    of the gods Shiva and Durga. You can visit several temples, have a “tika”
    drawn on your forehead, enjoy the landscape and even rub shoulders with wild
    monkeys (very mischievous for some, be careful with your belongings ) 2.
    Starting from Grand Bassin and heading south, you will pass through the
    small wild region of Plaine Champagne, famous for its dense forest and
    countless fruits. Many families come to pick Chinese guavas (a delicious
    sweet-tangy little fruit, if you have the opportunity to taste it!) in the
    middle of the year. Following the main road, you will come across the
    Alexandra waterfall a little further . I advise you to stop (there is
    parking) to admire this impressive waterfall. 3. Around noon or early
    afternoon, you will arrive at the Earth of the 7 Colors of Chamarel : it is
    the great natural curiosity of the island that attracts all visitors. It is
    a preserved natural area made of multicolored volcanic earth. A feast for
    the eyes. The Earth of the 7 Colors is in a private domain and the entrance
    is paying. 4. On the same private site as the Earth of the 7 Colors is also
    the Ebony Forest nature reserve which I advise you to visit if you have 2
    hours in front of you. On the program: walk in the middle of the native
    forest and breathtaking view of the whole valley from the Sublime Point. 5.
    And to end the day in style, nothing beats a guided tour of the Rhumerie de
    Chamarel, followed by a tasting of the best vintages (not recommended if you
    take the wheel right after of course ).

    Day 4. Belle Mare and Boat Trip to Ile aux Cerfs
  </h3>
  <p>
    Your 5-day itinerary in Mauritius continues, now heading to the east coast
    of the island! On the program for this fourth day, I suggest several
    heavenly beaches and a boat cruise to Île aux Cerfs. Are you tempted? So
    let’s go. Belle Mare beach is emblematic of the East of Mauritius.
    Impossible to miss with its 10 km of white sand. The shallow turquoise blue
    lagoon invites snorkelling and swimming-relaxation. It is a beach very
    popular with locals who come here in large numbers to camp on weekends.
    Going down to the south, you will then come across the much wilder Palmar
    beach , before arriving in the picturesque village of Trou d’Eau Douce. Its
    small beach lined with villas is worthy of the most beautiful postcards!
    From Trou d’Eau Douce you can take the boat to Île aux Cerfs, another
    must-see destination in Mauritius. Ile aux Cerfs is a small offshore island,
    uninhabited but very popular with tourists. What awaits you there? White
    sand, translucent lagoon and idleness galore.

  <h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Day 5. Port-Louis</h3>
  <p>
    I suggest you end this 5-day Mauritius itinerary with a cultural visit.
    History to see something other than the beaches before leaving, if that
    tells you! I therefore recommend that you go to Port-Louis, the capital, for
    this last day . You will discover the colonial history of Mauritius through:
    Place d’Armes : it is opposite the Government Palace . The statue of Mahé
    Labourdonnais (French governor who founded the city in 1735) stands in its
    center. Fort Adelaide (or Citadel of Port-Louis) : built in 1834 by the
    English on the heights of the city, this fortress was used at the time as a
    base for launching cannons against the French. the Blue Penny Museum : a
    very interesting little museum dedicated to Mauritian political history and
    art. Visiting Port-Louis also means immersing yourself in local life and
    experiencing the hustle and bustle of a bustling city (except on Sundays
    when everything is rather calm!). To fully experience all this, stroll
    freely through the streets and then go to the Central Market. This large
    covered market filled with colorful fruits, vegetables and spices will allow
    you to do some shopping.
